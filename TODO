Combat System:
- Expand the combat system in `game_modules/basics.py` to consider player and enemy inventory and skills.
- Implement different outcomes based on the player's and enemy's skills and weapons.
- Consider adding a system for critical hits or misses based on player's and enemy's "luck" attribute.

Market System:
- Create a new Market system where players can buy and sell items.
- This system should interact with the player's inventory.
- Consider different types of items to sell: weapons, potions, armor, etc.
- Implement a pricing system for the items. This could be static or dynamic (prices change based on certain conditions).
